# visited_again

Flutter project to revisit files from Downloads folder. Keep it or delete it. 

## Thought process
1. Get permission to file storage
2. Get random file
3. Display name of file, give option to open the file
4. Provide buttons to make decisions on the file, either keep the file where it is, share it on other apps like Drive, Telegram, or delete it.
